# shifumi-workshop

This is a JavaScript workshop to help improve your skills through building a shifumi game.

# How to play

* Pick either Rock, Paper or Scissors
* The computer will randomly chose either Rock, Paper or Scissors.
* The game will then see who the winner of that round is.
* If the player wins the round then the players score is incremented.
* If the computer wins then the computers score is incremented.
* If it is a draw the scores will remain the same.
* To reset the game you can simply refresh the page.

# Key things to consider when building out the game

* Think of all the possible outcomes for both the player and computer.
* Aim to create reusable blocks of code.
* Readability is important, keep your code simple.
* Break down your code into smaller functions.
